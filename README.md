# FindR
The FindR Chrome Extension.
FindR is a handy extension that does exactly what the name implies: it finds and replaces words, allowing you to completely change the text of any website.  This is great for pranking and trolling and just having fun with funny edits on pages. On a more practical note, it also has an input field option that allows you to easily find and replace all the text in input fields (such as forms, etc.).
